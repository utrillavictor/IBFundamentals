# About this workshop

Xcode is a modern, heavyweight and full-featured code editor, includes everything you need to create amazing apps for iPhone, iPad, Mac, Apple Watch, and Apple TV. In this course, we'll dive into using the Interface Builder editor within Xcode.

# What will we do?

We’ll begin by taking a look at how we can get things done by using the Storyboards to do as much heavy lifting for us as possible. Xcode has perfected the ability to:

* Visually lay out all your view controllers in “scenes” and describe the connections between them
* Describe transitions between various scenes. These transitions are called “segues” (pronounce: seg-ways) and you create them by connecting the view controllers in the Storyboard
* Working with table views is a lot easier with prototype and static cells features
* Make it easier to use Auto Layout

If you spend all day looking at and manipulating code, that's perfectly fine! but you may as well know how to deep into customizations using the evil drag 'n drop tool provided by the guys at Cupertino.

#### By the end of this day, you will:

* Get a tour over the Interface Builder editor within Xcode, after using it you’ll wonder how you ever lived without it!
* Get hands on experience with Storyboards in a variety of scenarios
* Learn how to connect “scenes”
* Learn about deep customization options that make a **REAL** difference in how you get things done
* Build your own “UI” and more…
